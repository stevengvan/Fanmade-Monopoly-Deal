## Monopoly Deal Online

Based on the Monopoly Deal card game, this project was intended to be accessible for everyone to try the game if they do not have a physical copy of the game. This project was made using React JS.

# Current State

At the moment the deck and card functionalities are currently being developed. Due to the nature of the game, this may take more time to test how to manipulate the cards between players.

The presentation of the game is purposefully minimal to put all attention to implementing the cards and deck. All colors are only used to distinguish the sections of the game.

# Running the Game

Running the `npm start` command in the terminal within the project directory will start a local server for the game to be launched.
